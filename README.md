## Description
In this project I created a weather app that allows the user to retreive weather data. The user will input which city/town they want data for and click search. This will fetch data from the API (https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) and display it on the page. The data listed includes temperature, wind speed, and humidity for the current day and the following 5 days. The API dayjs was also used to determine the day for each forecast data. 

The objective of this project was to build a weather dashboard that would run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. The weather data for cities was retrieved using the 5 Day Weather Forecast API from OpenWeatherMap. The base URL included the API key, longitude, and latitude of the city.

To retrieve geographical coordinates given a city name, the OpenWeatherMap APIs were used. The main technologies used in this project were HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The data retrieved from the API was dynamically updated on the HTML and CSS of the weather dashboard using JavaScript.

To store persistent data, localStorage was used. The weather dashboard built in this project allowed the user to search for weather data for a city and view the forecast for the next five days. The dashboard was built to be responsive to different screen sizes, making it easy for the user to access the weather data on different devices.

This project provided me with experience working with third-party APIs and using JavaScript to dynamically update HTML and CSS.
